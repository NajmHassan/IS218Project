	<h1>Docker to Azure Cloud</h1>
	<p>Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. 
	To get started you will need to install docker on your machine, create a docker hub account, create an azure account,
	have Git installed on the machine, and ide text editor such as PyCharm or vscode. </p>

	<p>To log in to azure use the docker command <strong>$ docker login azure</strong> this will take you to your web browser to login 
	to your azure account. After logging in you can close the window. To check what contexts are currently running on 
	the machine use the command <strong>$ docker context list</strong> which will show you the context you are using for the Docker 	
	commands which will have a “<strong>*</strong>” beside its name showing that is teh active context. </p>
	
	<p>Now to create and ACI context to run containers with. </p>
	<p><strong>$ docker context create aci --help</strong></p>
	<p>There will be flags shown to pass them and avoid the interactive questions to avoid this and pass the flags use </p>
	<p><strong>$ docker context create aci myaci</strong></p>

	<p>It will ask which subscription you would like to use if you have one then docker will use that. 
	Now we need to select a resource group. You can choose one that has been created previously or choose 
	“create a new resource group” using the arrow keys. If you choose to create a new one it will create it for you and give the 
	status message that it was created. Now use the <strong>$ docker context list</strong> command to check contexts and it 
	will show the ACI that was just created. </p>

	<p>Running containers on the cloud:</p>
	<p><strong>$ docker --context myaci run -d –name web -p 80:80 nginx </strong>. Docker will show that is has interacted 
	with ACI by creating a container named “web”.</p>
	<p>To switch contexts:</p>
	<p><strong>$ docker context use myaci</strong></p>
	<p><strong>$ docker ps</strong> This command will show the container instances running in the cloud rather than the local machine. 
	You can copy and paste the IP address shown into your browser to show the nginx web server running.</p>
	
	<p>To look at container logs:</p>
	<p><strong>$ docker logs web</strong></p>
	<p>To stop and remove the container:</p>
	<p><strong> $ docker rm web</strong></p>
